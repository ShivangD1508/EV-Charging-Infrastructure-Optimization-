### Introduction
The EV Charging Infrastructure Optimization project is designed to analyze and optimize the placement and utilization of electric vehicle charging stations. By leveraging data-driven insights, this project aims to improve accessibility, reduce charging wait times, and maximize resource efficiency for EV users and service providers.

### Features
- **Site Selection Analysis**: Identify optimal locations for new EV charging stations based on demand and traffic patterns.
- **Utilization Insights**: Monitor and analyze usage trends to ensure efficient resource allocation.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecast future demand for EV charging based on historical data and emerging trends.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Provide comprehensive dashboards for stakeholders to track performance metrics and KPIs.
- **Scalability Options**: Support for expanding infrastructure as EV adoption increases.
- **Integration Support**: Seamlessly integrates with existing energy grids and management systems.
